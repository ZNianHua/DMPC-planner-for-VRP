# DMPC-planner-for-VRP
## Introduction
Here are the codes of a DMPC-based online planner for time-optimal vehicle routing problems (VRPs). 
Codes are constructed by Python programming language via jupyternotebook. 
Relevant simulations are carried out via SUMO platform, and the results are available at

## Contribution
Main contribution is the improved route planning, which includes multi-vehicle cooperation, local communication topology and dynamic traffic issues. 
The results shows the proposed method provide a optimal route via online planning, which makes the ego vehicle find a faster way towards multiple targets. 
Furthermore, the proposed method is able to schedule the multi-vehicle systems without locked cycle.
